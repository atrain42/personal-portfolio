                Here you will see the projects I created in the courses I completed. You will see projects I created using JavaScript,
                Node.js, and React. I have included the links to the deployed sites, as well as all the source code that is located github.
                Course projects are only operable on computers, as the main focus was to write clean JavaScript code, rather then writing media queries.
                The main courses I took were HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and a React.js course.

                My portfolio also displays projects that I have created in my free time. I am always thinking of new ideas
                and enjoy expanding my coding skills by creating and deploying personal apps. I find the best way to learn code is 
                by creating personal projects. I have included links to the websites so you can view them. I plan to add more React 
                projects in the near future. I hope you enjoy!
